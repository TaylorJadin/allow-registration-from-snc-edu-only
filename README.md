This is a convenient place for me to keep track of single purpose snippets of php that I zip up and use on wordpress sites as plugins. Zip whichever one you want to use up (should be named like `remove-admin-stuff.zip`) and upload it to the wordpress front-end's plugins page to install. 

I zipped up Blur User Info for convenience, so you can download the zip of that directly here:
